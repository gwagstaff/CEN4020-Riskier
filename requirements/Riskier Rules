Battle Board
  •	When a province has two opposing armies present in it, a battle is triggered
  •	Opposing players take turns issuing orders to their units on the board
    o	Turn ends when all present units have acted
    o	The attacking player (the one who moved soldiers into the region/the one who doesn’t own the territory) goes first
    o	Either player can choose to flee on their turn
      	If the attacker flees, the defender wins and keeps their territory
      	If the defender wins, the attacker wins and takes the territory
      	[How to deal with left-over units]
  •	Remaining units return to player’s unit pool, or
  •	Remaining units get redistributed to adjacent friendly territory (men running away)
    o	Randomly distributed? Player choice?
  •	The battle ends when:
    o	One side has run out of units
    o	One side decides to flee the battle
  •	The winner gains or retains control of the region the battle took place in
